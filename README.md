# ROS2-BDI
A MAS (Multi Agent System) framework aiming to run on top of ROS2 Foxy, emulating the BDI architecture for implementing the agents' behaviour. The framework makes usage of an automated PDDL planner for computing plans in the means-end reasoning phase. Specifically it uses [PlanSys2](https://intelligentroboticslab.gsyc.urjc.es/ros2_planning_system.github.io/design/index.html).
